# post-exploitation-attack-using-python

Warning
--------
Please do not use this script for any illegal purposes. This script should only be used for educational purposes and learning about post-exploitation methods for penetration testing, ethical hacking and python programming.

Description
-----------
This project uses a P2P architecture between an attacker and a target to retrieve valuable information from the target. The pre-requisite for this is that the attacker has injected and executed the target python script (info_gather_target.py) in the target machine. Once this is done, the attacker just connects to the target on port 5000 using a socket. The following operations can be done by the attacker on the target machine:
1) Create a new user (CU)
2) Delete an existing user (DU)
3) Download registry key information (DRK)
4) Download a file (DF)
5) Gather information about the target using ipconfig, netstat, net accounts, net file, net localgroup, net session, net share, net user, and net view (GI)
6) Execute any command on the target machine (EC)

Requirements
------------
python=3.5 or above


How to use it?
--------------
Follow the steps mentioned below
1) Download info_gather_target.py script on the target machine and run it in administrator mode to fully utilize the script.
2) Run the info_gather_attacker.py script and mention the target machine's IP address.
3) Choose one of the options below to execute commands on the target machine
   CU  -  Create User
   DU  -  Delete User
   DRK -  Download Registry Key
   DF  -  Download File
   GI  -  Gather Information
   EC  -  Execute a custom command
   E   -  Exit
4) Choose option E if you want to exit
